    <p style="text-align: center;">A manifesto on details of moderation on the r/JaidenAnimations Discord Server.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="speech">
        <p>I'd first like to clarify that this article must be taken with a grain (maybe a spoonful) of salt. There's a lot of “radical-like” contents on this article, and it's better to start clarifying that not everything I say is what has to be done for improvement. Everything here is purely based on my opinion on experience, so the other people's one matters as well when considering any of this. However, this doesn't mean all I'm going to say should be rejected without discussion, I'd like to know that some of these ideas can stick to the wall and hopefully make the server moderation and state better.</p>
        <p>Naturally I'm not the most astounding voice when it comes to changes and reforms on this server (in fact, probably one of the least), but this page really puts my voice on things that I'd rather not talked about on the staff chat before, for it being reprehended.</p>
        <p>This page is a really long read. That's why I divided it in various parts to fit in categorized content. However, there are some sections that contain elements that are related to others. This page also has a lot of detail on little changes that can be done, but that's just for detailing. Down below, on the conclusion, I'll give a small list on the summary of changes of what has to be done. But please don't rush to that before reading all of the article, the detail is important.</p>
        <button class="collapsible">About punishments</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This headline should have the biggest text from the entire page, given how against I am to the current punishment system that entirely plagues the server from misfortune on many occasions. It is good to inform, before all, that the punishment system also has to do with the rules applied to it, and for so I will also dedicate a portion of the text on changes on rules. Also, it is great to know the base details of the current punishment system: a 1 through 5 warns punishment, where the first one would get a 6-hour mute, escalating (in punishment type and time) to days, weeks, and finally a permaban. I would've included the entire table with all the small details, but after long consideration I saw it very unethical, poor taste and unneeded, so I just stayed with the brief self-explanation to cover it up. People knowledgeable about our bans should somewhat know already how it goes, though.</p>

            <p>It is to note warns expire after 120 days (yes, 4 whole months of coping), that you're technically not meant to make more lenient punishments (even though I used to get away with that a lot), and that expired warns <b>can</b> count (at convenience of staff) to make up for harsher punishments. I feel like this system is too strict on some cases, and too lenient on others, due to the nature of counting up warns of any type at any instance. What I'm saying by this is: warns are currently given by <b>any</b> rule they'll break (because that's how staff want it to work, apparently), so a member that constantly breaks a similar low-level rule will have a harsher (or quicker, depends on the long-term) punishment that one that breaks a big rule in a more spaced-out manner. This, of course, not only leads to a loophole (that has fortunately not been exploited yet) on how the person will be punished, but also creates an unfair system that'll pick on unfortunate people who'd tend to make "not so morally incorrect" faults.</p>

            <p>Two major examples of this system gone wrong (with some biased selection) are Uber and Ahmed. Uber, having been counted so many times on the disruption rule, ended up being banned with no appeal (or a rejected one, my memory fails), quite shocking! However, I understand the massive dislike was the biggest factor to it, so I can't really use this as a big bold example. Ahmed, too, was permabanned with no appeal after falling on various counts of NSFW and/or NSFW talk; banned, appealed, and due to <i>really</i> bad timing on the expiration time (which is some other thing I don't agree with on this system) he was permabanned with no appeal.</p>

            <p>A potential solution, though more complicated than the current "1 count" warning system would be to give an average weighting to each rule and/or subsections of them (i.e. spam as a whole, or copypasta as a subsection), and give out a <i>fairly lenient</i> punishments table for the total warns' score. For example, a low spam warn would count for 1 point, if you get to 2 points you get a 1d mute, if you get to 5 a 7d mute, and if you get to 10 a permaban is highly considered.</p>

            <p>The warn expiration time with this system would be fine, but if you guys want to weigh higher than 5 points for certain rules, the time <b>has</b> to be lowered. If you guys don't want to implement this new system at all, <b>greatly decrement</b> the time, something like 2 or 3 months is good enough. Also, certain rules and trolling should be counted for an instant 10, it's good having quick effective systems to deal with instabans; but please don't abuse that with high-level warns like NSFW (not to confuse with NSFW spam, right as they join), those should get their own weigh.</p>

            <p>Regarding rules, there seems to be a really big stigma that “everything that's in rules is punishable with a warn (or higher) and should be and will be”. That was a stigma that I started noticing when rules were overhauled, and it stuck ever after. I think it has been quite apparent I am very against that common thought, given my measures on various situations versus the ones of other staff teams, even pointing them out jokingly. Not everything that's written on the rules channel should be punished, because rules aren't meant to excuse the need to punish people when they break them. There are various rules that can and should stay as rules in-text, but just so people can read them and understand what boundaries they should expect as members on the server. They shouldn't be all, again, excuses for dumbfounded punishments. One example of this would be the one-time spam rule subsections (copypasta, chainposting, wall of text, etc.), they aren't rules that are at all needed to warn to, simply talking to a member about it would be enough (this is also a point I'm going to cover later on).</p>

            <p>About warn expiration, I had already talked on this a bit above but I want to give a perspective of the expiration system that currently exists. Even though it is rewarding at some cases, since a person can recapacitate over time over mistakes and move on with them warns without any extra weight on their back, it can also put a lot of pressure on members on people to have to every day, every hour, follow rules from top to bottom. Naturally this is model behavior, but not everyone is perfect consistently and it's important to give leniency and more chances on people instead of picking on them, so that redemption can be more organic if they allow themselves to have such. I think a great example of someone who'd have benefited from this was Frank, frowned upon certain staff due to their toxicity at the start but a reality check and a break let them know they should reform their character, and so they did.</p>

            <p>Rules shouldn't be mechanically enforced 100% of the time; naturally efficiency is important, but giving so much restriction and tightness on how rules should be managed detracts quality of a Discord chat that is meant to be more spontaneous, and generally decreases the amount of potential fun it can get from talking. Obviously, this depends on the person, but judging to the demographic that stays active on the server it's not extremely relevant having a lot of restrictions.</p>

            <p>About verbal warnings, I feel like they're a great (if not the greatest) tool to help a member improve their behavior over time, and so staff shouldn't be afraid of using them more than other methods. Staff tend to have this inertia to need to punish through the bot rather than talking it out to the person itself and/or just weeding it out from the chat. An example of this would be, as expected from me, the one-time spam. There have been cases where a staff would go to warn through bot the spam without actually deleting the message (of course, the benefit of the doubt comes from forgetting, but it's weird it happened various times). A verbal warning instead would be way more useful on these scenarios to let people know what they shouldn't do more directly.</p>
            
            <p>Related to the verbal warnings part, staff should understand that most people can understand how to behave if it is told to them on a friendly manner. Naturally, some others would be a lost case, and therefore those are the ones who should start being punished through bot. We've seen various innocent members gone due to the rigidness of an “unbiased” system, where they could've been easily told to hold their horses and would've (likely) done so.</p>

            <p>Staff should also understand that people can change and can have a second chance (a third even) regardless of what they did. Naturally many will not change and as unfortunate as it can be they'll be banned and stay banned (specially if staff don't like them), but it's important to know that's not every single one and people should get a chance most of the time instead for working for a small appeal that'll be instantly rejected.</p>

            <p>Coming from there, I wanted to talk about the appeal system, which I see as quite retrograde. To begin with, people don't get the usually get their rejection reasons clarified, unless someone reaches them out directly to “leak them the staff chat”. It also is a tool for staff (me included) to rant and spit out <b>their</b> bad experiences with that person, and directly striking them out solely on the rules they broke (which, at that point, why even have an appeal system?) and/or the amount they took to break them, instead on focusing on whether the general community is fine with them or not (which is mostly easy to notice and ask for). A solution I'd advise for this is a simple use of a group of any form (appeals server, a GC, whatever) where people looking for an appeal can talk to, and make agreements in. It'd be a useful tool to also remind staff of the conditions they can agree in. Also, staff shouldn't be afraid of approving more appeals; that comes as an implicit statement on the last paragraphs but I felt like pointing it out was important.</p>

            <p>Other point related to this is the appeal conditions. Staff tend to forget that dealing with the current punishment system is already difficult to deal with when it comes to accumulated warns, and appeal conditions make it even more difficult. Having a “don't break any rules in certain period” condition is really extreme, specially when that period is more than a month. The improvement of them should, again, not be done on a “same-weight” warn system, but rather in their raw improvement of overall behavior as a hopefully reformed member. The best approach would probably just be watching over the specific user to see how much they've proven to be right from what they'd try to correct, and let them know what's to come if they don't seem to improve their behavior on a certain grace period beforehand.</p>

            <p>One small last thing to point out: punishments are done in the server and for the server, there should be an attempt to try not to count external behavior (DMs, other servers, etc.); naturally bias would form from it but it's the server what counts. I can't pinpoint any specific case where this has been a problem, but I saw it important to notice before something related happens. Also, I'm not saying to outright make a fully unbiased system on this (as the opposite will be apparent on the next section), just to not consider as much from other places rather than from the server itself. This stands even more true if the current punishment system exists.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">About dealing (leniently) with members</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Another big section of the website, and very related to the first part. You see I'm very into reforming the entire punishment system. However, this part is focused more on the moral aspect of punishing members rather than the objective part.</p>

            <p>A very unpopular but bold claim here to start off: Bias is fine, because many it serves as a method to justified a needed or highly requested punishment (usually a ban). The server has already very detailed rules, but there's still areas where certain behavior would fall under a gray area, or certain person would emit a vibe that cannot be punished in an “unbiased” way. Naturally the leniency given to someone will be dependent on the attitude of the staff towards certain people and on the pressure of the general public (I myself am included in this approach, but I'm not ashamed from it). It should be more standardized to apply a more “biased” punishment when no rules are available/applicable. This would surely spark a bigger discussion on whether they should be punished or not, and specially why (not), but that's where a voting system will come in handy. I'll go through more detail on it on the sections below.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">About rules</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Related to the sixth paragraph of Section 1, not all rules should be available for a needed punishment, and that applies for extra small details of rules that not everyone is bothered to read (a great example of this being rule 2, a jumble of small details that add up to different kinds of rules). In fact, rules should be kept somewhat concise so that they can really show, from a basis, how someone should behave, instead of going on through details that are easily forgettable. If a person knows a raw, generalized base on what they should be talking about the small details can start being discovered from there, and over time; rather than having to constantly keep in mind those explicit details, when they just want to have a casual talk. It'd help so that a community can be built over different interpretations of what “good behavior” means for each, and start making up decisions from there.</p>

            <p>Expanding on the “concise rules” part, I don't really see necessary anymore (because I used to do) on giving long descriptions on each rule. Some rules don't really even need their description, or it can be shortened, or separated in various rules. The format of the current rules message can be changed to plaintext to permit that. Giving my personal touches to some rules:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Rule 1's part of loud audio shouldn't even be in that rule, it should deserve its own rule.</li>
                <li>Rule 2 has always been the rule I had most trouble with. Chainposting should deserve its own rule, given it is of such relevance to avoid it (apparently). Non-English conversations isn't even a type of spam, it should get its own rule as well.</li>
                <li>Rule 3 doesn't really need a description on itself (or so I think, it's up to you guys).</li>
                <li>Rule 4 doesn't need detailed examples, I feel like the commands in #commands is already good enough. “Do not mix between channels” is also unneeded, that's the point of the rule.</li>
                <li>Rule 9 can be shortened, or so I believe. I leave this one to your interpretation.</li>
                <li>Rule 10 should say it can only be done in the selfpromo channel. Also, I'm pretty sure advertisements of, say, servers, aren't against ToS, but just make clear it's a bit unethical to go to that and it can be punished. Also, it can be shortened.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Also, just to take advantage of this section: the info channel should include stuff like some permissions given out by the level roles, because it's something many people ask. Also, hopefully, add the punishments table, though I know that won't happen, but I'm just sayin' ;)</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">About decision methods and suggestions</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Something important about a healthy staff team and community is taking feedback and making fair decisions from it. Fairness can come in many different ways, the most common one has been simply speaking out on it. However, naturally some people would speak out more astoundingly than others and it may cause a certain decision to be generally disliked (either by most of other staff, or by the general public). So, the solution to that is, on the purest way, a voting system. I have already talked about it, and while it has been generally liked it hasn't been considered. A good approach would be making a staff voting channel and/or thread, where there'd be a space for voting and another space for discussing about certain decision. This approach has been done in a more robust way on some ban appeals (or on decisions that were derived to a discussion-only channel), and I feel like it's a system that can be further implemented for more occasions.</p>

            <p>A good detail of this approach would be to try to isolate voting from discussion, because discussions tend to get lengthy, messy and/or railed out from the main topic. It's also important that most if not all staff can vote independently, and hopefully anonymously, so that there wouldn't be as much disturbance on the outcome of the votes, and the real intentions of each staff.</p>

            <p>Regarding standard, suggestions, I personally feel like the suggestions' voting system has gone stale, because usually it doesn't matter the outcome of upvotes and it's usually just a small consideration rather than the actual feel of that suggestion from staff. Maybe votes can be removed from it, and they can simply be accepted or denied by staff? Reactions put pressure (to the members, not the staff) over decisions that aren't necessarily encouraged or liked by staff, so it'd be a nice touch to avoid that being there to reduce false impressions. While it would feel really detrimental to remove that ability for new members, because it strips something they used to have, it's not something that's going to be highly demanded to be returned, specially considering members who were used to the suggestions system already knew the deal over the vote reactions (and I mean, it's also clarified in the channel topic anyhow), so what gives?</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">About staff changes</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This is something I'm not actively seeking out for changes, but rather a reminder to staff to keep on with things that are sometimes avoided to do. Staff members seem to keep on as stagnant, select people who are sought for when they're active and get to keep and/or escalate in their role, as they contribute to moderation on the server. However, over time that activity will fade out, and therefore their ability to partake on moderation activities. So, it's important to consider every now and then when to start introducing new people that, at least, look fit for the team. Older staff don't have to necessarily be ousted from the team, because while they do less work they can still give a hand in case of any favor. Of course, if a staff is starting to lack a lot on their overall interaction on staff (which will probably be my case too, that's why I'm foreseeing it), there should start to be a consideration on whether that person should still be part of it. But that's just on very justified cases, usually it'd be more essential to add people than to remove.</p>

            <p>Another thing I saw (which was actually just attitude of 1 person, somehow supported by the others), having many people under certain tier (i.e. mods) is fine. There's no need to fight for a limited amount of staff (which is why I also advised earlier to add more staff than removing). I believe the “Helpers” role should, in fact, be used more as a tool to provide with people with a “Trial Mod” experience (just like many other servers will do when they just introduce someone to the team), and after some time of modding they can be promoted. Helpers shouldn't really be a role used for static purposes, just a way to get the feet wet, or to demote someone with a “limbo” state in a necessary case. Perhaps, the role could even be renamed to represent what I'm proposing.</p>
    
            <p>Feel free to add more admins as I'm gone; people who you guys think are capable of exerting the role of, well, administrating (and without downgrading yourselves, you guys are really capable), can be on such position, and it'd be nice to start promoting people to there without much liquidity to have variety on the power.</p>
    
            <p>However, I'd lastly like to note that staff specific roles are more cosmetic than anything. There're times where there'd be an unneeded “grind” for escalation of power when the roles hold similar power. So, it's important to make clear that positions on the hoisting don't really attribute anything as special to, i.e., admins and mods, as per both can normally execute most activities equally, and their quality is instead valued on the wrapper staff role. I wanted to say this because there tends to be low morale when there's little possibility of a higher hoisted role. Though, in case necessary of more permissions given by each role, a promotion should be really considered, regardless of the staff count.</p>
        </div>
        <p>I hope all the insights I provided were of utility and interest. I'm sorry if I wasn't clear in many of the aspects I covered, I brainstormed most of the ideas without much filtering. I'm sorry if there are points that contradict each other, or that contradict what I used to do in the server, I just feel like there's various solutions and/or points of view to the aforementioned problems. I'm sorry I made such a long read, I felt the need to detail a lot of what I could've explained in a few messages, kinda to serve as legacy and also to not leave some ideas hanging around, because I probably won't want to further explain them after I publish this. As I said in the main page, it was a great pleasure to be on this server, a great pleasure to moderate it for so much time, and I only hope for better stuff for it and the members I love from there. I might try to join the staff team back once I manage to adapt fully to the responsibilities if I'm allowed to do so, and/or will check the state of the changes I proposed. Maybe some things worked out, maybe some didn't, only time will tell. With Pent as the new owner and a possible restaff, I assure things will be very good moving forward. Hopefully we're in good terms after I publish this, and I only hope for the best.</p>
        <p>Here's a summary of changes I talked about on this entire article:</p>
